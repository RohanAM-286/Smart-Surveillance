# 🛡️ Smart Surveillance System – Unknown Face Detection using YOLO

A smart surveillance system built using **YOLOv5** and **OpenCV**, capable of detecting unknown faces in real-time and logging their appearances for security and monitoring purposes.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🎯 Detects **unknown faces** from live camera or video feed  
- 💾 Stores detected unknown faces in a **separate folder** with timestamped filenames  
- 🕒 Logs **date and time** of detection into a structured **CSV file**  
- 🔁 Works in real-time for continuous surveillance  
- 🧠 Uses **YOLOv5** for object detection and **face comparison** to classify faces as known or unknown

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- YOLOv5 (PyTorch)  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Pre-trained models for face recognition (e.g., `face_recognition` or custom encodings)
